#  Weather Dashboard Application

This is a weather dashboard application with search functionality to find current weather conditions and the future weather outlook for multiple cities. The [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) was used to retrieve weather data for cities. 

* AJAX was used to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.

* The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

* The following is displayed under "current weather conditions:"

  * City

  * Date

  * Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)

  * Temperature

  * Humidity

  * Wind speed

  * UV index

* A search history is included, so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name performs a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city. 

* A 5-Day Forecast is provided below the "current weather conditions". Each day for the 5-Day Forecast displays the following:

  * Date

  * Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)

  * Temperature

  * Humidity


The Geolocation API is used to add the user's current location to the initial landing page.
